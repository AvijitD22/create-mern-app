# MERN Automation Script

This script automates the setup process for a full-stack web development project using React for the frontend and Node.js for the backend. It creates the necessary project structure, initializes a Git repository, configures the server-side and client-side environments, and sets up the project dependencies.

## Note:
If your Python executable is located in a different directory, make sure to update the Shebang line (`#!C:\Python310\python`) at the beginning of the `create_app.py` script to point to the correct Python location on your system.


## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository:** Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

2. **Set Up Environment Variables:**

   To make the script usable from any path in Windows, you can add the directory containing the script to the system's PATH environment variable. Here's how you can do it:

   - **Open Start Menu:** Click on the Start menu and search for "Environment Variables".

   - **Edit System Environment Variables:** Click on "Edit the system environment variables".

   - **Environment Variables:** In the System Properties window, click on the "Environment Variables" button.

   - **Edit PATH Variable:** In the Environment Variables window, locate the "Path" variable under System variables and click on "Edit".

   - **Add Script Directory:** Add the full path to the directory containing the script (`create_app.py`) to the list of paths in the PATH variable. For example, if the script is located in `C:\Scripts`, add `C:\Scripts` to the PATH variable.

   - **Save Changes:** Click "OK" to save the changes and close all the windows.
   - Restart the pc/laptop if script is not accessible.

3. **Run the Script:** Execute the script with the following command:

    ```bash
    python create_app.py <project_name>
    ```

    Replace `<project_name>` with the desired name for your project.

4. **Follow the Prompts:** The script will guide you through the setup process, creating the project structure and configuring both the frontend and backend environments.

5. **Start Development:** Once the script has completed successfully, you can start developing your project immediately. The frontend and backend are ready to run.

## How It Helps

- **Time-Saving:** Automates the repetitive tasks involved in setting up a new full-stack project, saving developers time and effort.

- **Consistency:** Ensures consistency in project structure and configuration, reducing errors and making collaboration easier.

- **Efficiency:** Quickly sets up the development environment with all dependencies installed and configured, allowing developers to focus on building features rather than setup.

- **Git Integration:** Initializes a Git repository, making it easy to manage version control and collaborate with team members.

- **Modularity:** Separates frontend and backend configurations, allowing developers to work on each independently while maintaining integration.

- **Customization:** The script can be customized further to include additional configurations or technologies as per project requirements.

By using this automation script, developers can kickstart their full-stack web development projects quickly and efficiently, enabling faster time-to-market and smoother development workflows.
